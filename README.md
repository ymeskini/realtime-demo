# Realtime with WebSockets

This is a simple demo how we can use WebSockets with Node and React to create a realtime application.

# Start the app

To start the app, run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

It'll start the server on `http://localhost:5555`
And the client on `http://localhost:5173`
